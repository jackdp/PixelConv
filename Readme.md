# PixelConv

## About

PixelConv is a small program that allows you to convert screen sizes between three units: pixels, millimeters and logical inches.

I wrote this program for my own use, but maybe it will be useful for someone else.  
Sometimes I have to convert pixels to millimeters (and vice versa), then I use PixelConv.

The PixelConv can also be considered as a demonstration application of my [JPL.PixelConv.pas](https://github.com/jackdp/JPLib/blob/master/Graphics/JPL.PixelConv.pas) unit.
